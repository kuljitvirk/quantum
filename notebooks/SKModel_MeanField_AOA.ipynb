    "The constants $\\Delta_i > 0$, which ensures that the ground state of $H_D$ is a product state of qubits in $+1$ eigenstate of $\\sigma^x$. The alternating sequence arises from the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) [2]. The QAOA is a general-purpose algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems more general than the SK model. However, its application to finding the ground state energy of the SK model is a valuable benchmark. The alternating sequence also arises from the quantum adiabatic algorithm, which aims to take the ground state of the solvable Hamiltonian $H_D$ into the one for the difficult case of $H_P$, via the evolution\n",
