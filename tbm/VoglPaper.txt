Ah&ret--A nearest-neighbor semi-empirical tight-binding theory of energy bands in zincblende and diamond
structure materials is developed and applied to the following sp3-bonded semiconductors: C, Si, Ge, Sn, SIC, GaP,
GaAs, GaSb, InP, InAs, InSb, AIP, AlAs, AISb, ZnSe, and ZnTe. For each of these materials the theory uses only
thirteen parameters to reproduce the major features of conduction and valence bands. The matrix elements
exhibit chemical trends: the differences in diagonal matrix elements are proportional to differences in free-atom
orbital energies and the off-diagonal matrix elements obey the de2 rule of Harrison et al. The lowest energy
conduction bands are well described as a result of the introduction of an excited s state, s*, on each atom.
Examination of the chemical trends in this sp’s* model yields a crude but “universal” sp’s* model whose
parameters do not depend explicitly on band gaps, but rather are functions of atomic energies and bond lengths
alone. The “universal” model, although cruder than the sp’s* model for any single semiconductor, can be
employed to study relationships between the band structures of different semiconductors; we use it to predict band

edge discontinuitiesof heterojunctions.
1. INTRODUCTION

Now that semiconductors can be grown with varying
composition a few atomic layers at a time [I], the number
of conceivable new electronic devices and materials for
improving the performance of existing devices will increase many-fold. This situation will put new demands
on theorists to predict the properties of exotic semiconductors before the materials are even fabricated. This
need to survey and simulate wide classes of semiconducting materials is not well met by most conventional
theories, which concentrate on the accurate description
of a few semiconductors. A notable exception, however,
is the empirical Bond Orbital Model pioneered by
Harrison[2,3]; this model provides a simple nearestneighbor tight-binding theory of valence bands and how
they change as the chemistry of the semiconductor
varies. With this model, one can estimate the nature of
the filled, bonding valence bands of almost any semiconductor. However, a comparable model that also describes the empty anti-bonding conduction states is
needed.
In this paper we present such a model. We maintain
the spirit of Harrison’s model of semiconductors by
constructing a nearest-neighbor tight-binding theory
which preserves and displays chemical trends, while
successfully reproducing the unoccupied anti-bonding

lower conduction bands as well as the occupied bonding
valence bands. In order to achieve these goals we have
found, by trial and error, a chemically-correct tightbinding theory with a minimum number of parameters.
We have replaced the actual semiconductor Hamiltonian
with a pseudo-Hamiltonian[4] which (i) involves only a
small number of localized pseudo-orbitals[S], (ii) has
off-diagonal matrix elements that are significant only
between states localized on adjacent sites, and (iii) has
diagonal matrix elements that are determined by the free
atom orbital energies of the semionductor’s chemical
constituents and are only weakly influenced by the condensed-matter environment [6]. Such a replacement of
the Hamiltonian was recently shown to produce an
adequate
pseudo-Hamiltonian[5,6].
The resulting
pseudo-orbital basis functions turn out to be atomiclike[6, ‘II-although atomic orbitals themselves (as were
used in early linear combination of atomic orbitals
models) do not provide an adequate pseudo-Hamiltonian
basis. The spirit of the pseudo-Hamiltonian replacement
procedure is analogous to that of conventional empirical
pseudopotential theory [8]: the matrix elements of the
pseudo-Hamiltonian are adjusted to fit optical band gaps,
thereby constraining the theory to produce a reasonable
band structure.
Our model has all of the following properties: (i) the
chemistry of sp3 bonding is manifestly preserved; (ii) the
diagonal matrix elements of the model are related to the
atomic energies of the chemical constituents, permitting
exploration of chemical trends, simple treatment of al365

loys, and theories of semiconductors with defects; (iii)
the off-diagonal matrix elements scale as the inverse
square of the bond length (the d-* scaling rule of the
Bond Orbital Model[2,3]); (iv) the model employs a
minimum number of parameters, only nearest-neighbor
matrix elements; and (v) the theory successfully
reproduces not only the valence bands but also the
lowest conduction band, even in indirect gap semiconductors. Other empirical tight-binding theories lack one
or more of these properties.
Theories with fewer than eight bands cannot describe
the chemistry of localized states in covalently bonded
semiconductors: the sp3 bonding of zincblende and
diamond structures demands a basis set of at least four
orbitals for each of the two atoms in the unit cell,
namely, one s and three p orbitals per atom. Tight
binding theories with more than nearest-neighbor matrix
elements have been discussed extensively in the classic
paper of Slater and Koster [9]. For example, a zincblende
structure with an sp3 basis for each atom requires 9 and
23 independent parameters for first- and second-nearestneighbor tight binding theories, respectively. In practice,
attempts to determine extended-neighbor tight-binding
parameters empirically are faced with so many adjustable parameters that least-squares fitsHO] to pseudopotential bands are normally employed. The resulting
parameters, although quite useful for a single semiconductor, cannot be confidently used to discuss different
semiconductors, such as alloys, by interpolation,
because the fitting procedure is insensitive to the chemistry and chemical trends in the band structure
parameters. Moreover, the basic spirit of empirical tightbinding theory is to minimize the number of empirical
parameters by restricting the number of non-zero matrix
elements. Therefore, to preserve simplicity and to permit
easy identification of chemical trends in the band structure, we limit our consideration to a nearest-neighbor
tight-binding theory.
Attempts to fit the conduction bands of semiconductors with a nearest-neighbor sp’ tight-binding model have
generally failed; for example, Chadi et nl.[ll] showed
that such a model cannot produce an indirect fundamental band gap in zincblende or diamond materials, and
hence cannot adequately describe even the lowest conduction bands of such important semiconductors as Si,
Ge, AIAs, or GaP. The nearest-neighbor sp’ model fails
to produce an indirect gap for Si because it omits essential physics: the excited atomic states, such as the s*
state of atomic Si, couple with the anti-bonding p-like
conduction states of Si near the X and L points of the
Brillouin zone, and press these states down in energy.
The present theory overcomes this deficiency by including an excited s-state, s*, on each atom, giving an sp3s*
basis and a ten-band theory. The excited s* state repels
the lower, unoccupied energy levels of the neighboring
atom, and, in particular, presses the indirect relative
conduction band minima down in energy.
In an $-basis there are four diagonal matrix elements
(s- and p-orbital energies for each atom) and five independent nearest neighbor transfer matrix elements
(V(s, s), V(x, x), Vx, Y). Usa, PC), and WC, pa)).

et al.

These parameters all have physical significance; our
procedure is to first determine them by fitting the pseudopotential bands[l2], and then to augment the basis
with the s* state which, in this model, introduces a
diagonal matrix element and off-diagonal matrix elements, only two of which we take to be non-zero: the
couplings between s* and p orbitals on adjacent sites.
The reason for treating the s* states a posterion’ is that
they are simply devices for producing accurate indirect
band edges. The inclusion of some such excited states in
any minimal basis set is physically important-although
the precise physics of the actual excited states need not
be faithfully and quantitatively reproduced. One would
see this by executing a first-principles band calculation
for a semiconductor: various excited states (including d
states) must be introduced in order to obtain the correct
band structure, because these excited states repel the
energy levels below them, influencing the width of the
conduction bands in particular. A central physical point
of the present work is that any excited state that depresses the states below can be used to improve the sp3
nearest-neighbor model conduction bands; therefore
extensions of the model to distant-neighbor matrix elements (with the proliferation of adjustable matrix elements) can be avoided by introducing an s* state.
In Section 2 we present the model Hamiltonian; the
determination of its matrix elements is discussed in
Section 3. The resulting matrix elements have scaling
properties discussed in Section 4. Our results are summarized in Section 5. Appendix A contains the predicted
band structures, and the remaining Appendices discuss
details of the model.
2.MODEL HAMILTONIAN

We construct the zincblende-structure tight-binding
Hamiltonian in a basis of quasi-atomic functions
(nbk) = N-“*z

exp (ik.Ri + ik.vh)lnbRi).

(1)

The quantum numbers n run over the s, px, py, pz, and s*
orbitals; the N wavevectors k lie in the first Brillouin
zone[l3]; the site index b is either a (for anion) or c (for
cation); the anion positions are Ri; and, in terms of the
Kronecker 8, we have vb = S,,,(aJ2)(1, 1,l). The quasiatomic functions are Lowdin orbitals: symmetrically
orthogonalized atomic orbitals [14]. The Schrlidinger
equation for the Bloch functions Ikh) is
(H - c(kh))lkA) = 0,

The solutions are

The band index A has ten values. The Hamiltonian

nine parameters, four diagonal energies and five transfer

excited s state, s*, in our ten-band sp’s* model, and
permit only coupling to p-states on adjacent sites, omitting, for simplicity, the coupling to s-states on different
sites [IS]. Thus we have four additional matrix elements,

(a) The sp’ model
In selecting a scheme for determining the matrix ele-

ments, we concentrate on producing energy bands which
mimic the nonlocal pseudopotential bands[l2], and, in
particular, reproduce the spectral densities of states. The
reason for paying close attention to the densities of
states is our desire to employ the empirical Hamiltonian
for localized defect calculations; such computations are
extremely sensitive to minor redistributions of state
density[l6-181.
For clarity of presentation, we discuss only GaP in the
main text, leaving the discussion of other semiconductors to Appendix A. We eschew least-squares
methods[lO] of fitting the bands in favor of careful
treatment of the k = 0 P-point and the k = (27r/aL)(l, 0,O)
X-point of the Brillouin zone. (The highest valence band
maximum of GaP is at r and the lowest conduction
minima are at X.) In terms of the band energies at X and
r (see Fig. I), we have expressions for the tight-binding
matrix elements as functions of the diagonal energies

E(s, c) + E(s, a) = E(T,“) + E(T,‘),
and
E(P, c) f E(p, a) = E(K) - E(K).

(10)

Seven of these nine energies are fixed by the band
structure at seven points: I,, 115, X,, X,, and X5 in the
valence band, and I, and 115 in the conduction band.
(Note that the pseudopotential band structure is normally
fit to reflectivity and photoemission data. Thus, by adjusting our tight-binding model to fit that band structure,
we are, in reality, fitting the primary data.)
The remaining two energies are determined by fixing
the differences in diagonal matrix elements:
D, = E(l, c)-E(l,

a).

(11)

These are assumed to be functions of the atomic orbital
energies w(1, b) of Table 3. Expanding D, to lowest order
in the neutral atom energies and recognizing that D, = 0
for homonuclear semiconductors, we find
D, =E(l,c)-E(l,a)=/.?,(w(l,c)-

~(],a)).

(12)

The constants /3, should be nearly equal for a variety of
zincblende hosts, because the elements forming the
zincblende compounds are all chemically similar (especially the III-V’s). Indeed, we find p, = 0.8 and &, = 0.6
using the procedures of Appendix B. These last two
constraints serve to completely determine the parameters
of the sp3 band structure.
A crucial test for the internal consistency of the model
is provided by the amount of charge transferred from the
cation to the anion. The same diagonal matrix elements
can be used for an atom in different chemical environments only if the pseudoatoms are nearly neutral entities.
Once we have fixed the Hamiltonian parameters, we
calculate the net charge per anion or cation by performing an energy integral over valence band states of the
local density of states[l9] per atom. We find this charge
to be small indeed-typically one-tenth of an electron
charge.
A modicum of justification for the assumption that the
differences D, are functions solely of atomic orbital
energies is available from Bullett’s chemical pseudopoHarrison’s
Bond-Orbital
theory[6]
and
tential
Model[2,3]. These methods of atomic and solid-state
physics show that the electronic properties of an atom in
a solid can be simulated by functions which depend on
the atomic energies of neutral atoms; we are adopting a
corresponding phenomenology.
The computed sp’ band structure for GaP is given in
Fig. 1 where it is compared with the pseudopotential
band structure[l2], which was empirically adjusted to
reproduce the available data. The valence bands of the
sp3 model are good but the lowest conduction band,
which has too much dispersion, does not have minima near
the X points of the Brillouin zone.

et al.

(b) The sp%* model
To remedy this deficiency of the sp’ model, we add an
excited s state to the basis, and couple it to the p states
in such a way that it can reduce the dispersion in the
conduction band and drive the relative minima at X to
lower energy (Fig. 2). This s* state is actually an ad hoc
device that permits adjustment of the lowest conduction
band near X (and also near L). Addition of s* is simpler
than augmenting the basis with d orbitals, which would
necessitate treatment of higher angular momentum states
and the development of unique empirical prescriptions
for d matrix elements. The addition of an excited state to
the basis set is to be preferred over extension of the
model to second and more distant neighbors because the
repulsion of the conduction band by the excited state
plays a central role in fixing the indirect gaps. Economy
of parameters also argues against the proliferation of
comparably sized matrix elements associated with allowance for second-nearest-neighbor interactions.
The expected s* states are allowed to interact only
with the p states on the nearest neighbor atom. The s*
states, being at higher energy, repel the p-like conduction
band levels near X and L downward in energy, producing the desired indirect band structure.
The excited s* state energies E(s*) listed in Table 3
were derived from spectroscopic energy levels by
averaging over multiplets of angular momentum, as described in Appendix C.
The coupling of the s* states to the p-state is chosen
to reproduce the X-point energy of each of the two
lowest conduction bands. For the zincblende lattice,
V(s*a,pc) is adjusted to fit the XI’ energy and

V(pa, s*c) is fixed to fit the X3’ energy. The parameters
of the sp’ model are retained without alteration; the two

The resulting sp3s* band structure is in good
agreement with the pseudopotential band structure (Fig.
2) and the density of states agrees with the photoemission data[23] (Fig. 3).
4.SCALINGPROPERTIES
OF TAE MATRIXELEMENTS
AND THR UNIVERSAL
MODEL

(a) Scaling properties of matrix elements
To a good approximation, the off-diagonal matrix
elements determined in the sp3 model have the d-*
scaling law of the Bond Orbital Model (see Fig. 4), where
d is the bond length (d = d(3)aJ4). This property is
extremely useful for treating lattice relaxation around
defects or at surfaces, because it gives prescriptions for
the matrix elements in the relaxed material in terms of
the perfect crystal matrix elements.
The differences in diagonal matrix elements E(1, c)E(1, a), by construction, are proportional to the
differences in atomic energies w(1, c) - w(1, a).

(b) The “universal” model
Except for the sums of diagonal matrix elements,
E(1, c)+ E(1, a), which have not yet been related to
atomic energies or bond lengths, the sp3s* model has all
of its matrix elements approximately fixed by the atomic
energies of the constituents and a set of “universal”
constants. In other words, this work suggests that all
zincblende and diamond semiconductors have electronic
structures that can be predicted crudely from a simple
“universal” model of the energy bands, which involves
only atomic energies and a set of universal off-diagonal
matrix elements.
To formulate a “universal” model, we attempt to
directly relate the sums E(l, c) + E(1, a) to atomic energies. We find, in analogy with eqn (ll), that, to a satisfactory approximation:
E(l,c)tE(l,a)={l

ta,}{w(l,c)t

w(l,a)}.

A modicum of justification for this form of a relationship
between the energies in the solid and in the atom is given
in Appendix D.
Thus we have the following “universal” model of
semiconductor electronic structure whose matrix elements for each semiconductor depend solely on the
neutral-atom orbital energies of its constituents and its
lattice constant. The diagonal matrix elements, which
represent orbital energies within the solid, are defined in

terms of sums and differences of neutral atomic orbital
energies (see eqn (11) and eqns (D3) and (D4) of Appendix D). The values a, = 0.2 and ap = 0.4 follow from
the empirical determination of /?, (see Appendix B) and
the relation al = 1 -PI. The off-diagonal matrix elements, also known as transfer energies, are obtained by
the de2 scaling rule: V(i) = p( i)d-‘. The five
coefficients v”(i) (see Fig. 4) were obtained by averaging
over the semiconductors listed in Table 1. The resulting
coefficients in eV, are p(s, s) = -42.15, V”(x,x) = 11.19,
~(x, y) = 27.88, p(sa, pc) = 29.61, and ~(sc, pa) =
33.76.
The universal model accurately simulates the valence
band energies and spectral densities of states (Figs. 6 and
7). The center of the conduction bands and their general
features (lowest-energy moments) are also reproduced.
However, the detailed features of the band structure,
such as the optical bandgap, are not very accurately
predicted. In addition to the broad features of the
valence bands, the absolute energy placements, with
respect to the vacuum reference, of the valence and
conduction band edges are predicted.
Predictions of the discontinuities of the valence band
edges are directly made with the universal model, which
estimates the absolute energies of the valence band

maxima. The valence band edge energy for each compound depends on the p-orbital energies of its atoms and
the interatomic matrix elements V(x, x) = p(x, x)d-‘:

J%= L&P, c) + E(P, all/2 - [(E(p, c) - E(p, a))’
+ 4 V(x, x)*11’*/2.

Using the equilibrium bond length d for each compound,
we predict E. and find that it is nearly a linear function
of the bond length (Fig. 7). Such a linear trend with bond
length suggests that experimenters’ efforts to match lattice constants of the alloys used in heterojunctions may
also serve to nearly match valence band edges as well.
That remains a useful strategy even though the band
discontinuity of any specific lattice-matched heterostructure does not become exactly zero either in our
theory or in the data. One should focus on the general
trend displayed in Fig. 7, which clearly demonstrates that
lattice-matched heterojunctions tend to have small
valence band discontinuities.
The predictions of band-discontinuities at heterojunction interfaces can be made directly from Fig. 7. The
bandstructure discontinuity of the valence band,
SE(A, B) = E(&; A)- E(r;,; E), is obtained from the
maximum valence band energies, E(T&; A) and
E(r;,; B), of the two interfaced semiconductors. The
conduction band discontinuity SE(A, IQ follows from the
known bandgaps of these two semiconductors. Our
values for the Ge/Si and the Ge/GaAs interfaces, two of
the few that have been measured and published, are
within 0.5 eV agreement of the published data and other
theoretical estimates (see Table 5). Predictions for other
interfaces can be made by examining Fig. 7. For instance, AlAs and GaAs have very similar lattice constants, and thus their valence band discontinuity is small:

In summary, we have developed an sp’s* empirical
nearest-neighbor tight-binding model that reproduces the
valence and conduction band structures of major semiconductors.
In separate work we have successfully applied this
model to several problems. These include the following:
the theory of deep impurity levels in homopolar and
heteropolar
semiconductors
and
semiconductor
aiioysii7j; the theory of core excitons in the buiI~25j, at
interfaces [26], and at surfaces [27]; surface state
theory[28]; models of deep traps at interfaces[29] and
lattice-relaxed surfaces[30]; and a theory of extended,
paired substitutional defects[31].

P. VooL et al.

The “universal” model extracted as an approximation
to the sp’s* model promises to be a useful model for
global theoretical studies of chemicaf trends in semiconductors; for example, estimates of the band discontinuities as a function of lattice mismatch for heterojunctions.

An approximation 0,” to the difference Dp in the diagonal
matrix elements for p orbitals can be extracted from data using a
relationship[l I] among Dr,,the Tls conduction band energy, the
spin-orbit splitting & of the highest two valence bands, and the
atomic spin-orbit splittings of the anion and cation A, and A,:

to relate the energies in the solid, E(1, b), to neutral atom orbital
energies w(l, b) of Table 3 (b = a for the anion and b = c for the
cation). The coefficients u,, representing the admixture of the
nearest neighbor, are small, and depend on the symmetry I and
the lattice constant aL. In our crude model we ignore their
dependence on lattice constant [34].
The diagonal energies enter the calculation as sums S1 and
differences D, which are defined by the atomic energies:
S,=E(l,c)tE(l,a)=(ltal)(w(l,c)tw(l,a)),

By plotting 0,” vs the neutral atom energy difference w(p, c)w(p, a) for several semiconductors we find the average value 0.6
for & = D,‘/(w(p, c) - w(p, a)). (See Fig. 8 and Table 3.)

APPENDIX C

The s and p orbital energies were obtained from Hartree-Fock
calculations for neutral atoms[32]. The s* orbital energies were
obtained from tabulated spectroscopic data[33]. Associated with
each p orbital in a term of angular momentum J was a transition
energy; an average energy was obtained by weighting each
transition energy by a multiplicity factor of 2J t 1.

Orbital energies within the solid

The Lowdin orbital of symmetry 1 at a specific site is composed primarily of the atomic orbital at that site with a slight
admixture from neighboring sites. The component from an orbital at a neighboring site depends on its overlap with the primary
orbital; this overlap decreases sufficiently rapidly with distance
that to a good approximation we can ignore the effect of all but
the nearest neighbor atoms. In the spirit of this model, we
assume that the diagonal matrix elements are functions of the

Fig. 10. Shows the relationship of orbital energies in the solid to
neutral atom orbital energies. See eqn (W). The fact that the
points cluster along the diagonal of the figure indicates that the
sums of the anion and cation orbital energy differences, obtained
from the “universal” model (see eqns Dl and D2), agree with
those directly determined from the experimental band structure.
Here we use & =0.7; in Fig. 9 we would find a better fit with
0, = 0.5. Thus we settle on the average value of 0.6.

navmg oenneo me absoiute energies of tight-binding orbitais
within the solid, we can compute the corresponding energies of
the tight-binding bandstructures. These cannot be directly compared with experiments such as photoemission, because the
tight-binding bands do not include effects, mainly electron-electron correlation effects, which in general shift the bands to higher
energy. Other more sophisticated methods, such as the Hartree
Fock method, also produce bands that are too low in energy[35].
Because such energy shifts are nearly constant, as demonstrated
by the Bond Orbital Model[2,3], we can construct an indirect,
internal test of the absolute energies of the tight-binding orbitals
within the solid. The test consists of computing the differences of
two quantities, $ and S,, which are then compared with the
corresponding dtfferences computed from experimental band
structures. From the tight-binding Hamiltonian we obtain
