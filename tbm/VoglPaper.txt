             Ah&ret--A nearest-neighbor semi-empirical tight-binding theory of energy bands in zincblende and diamond
             structure materials is developed and applied to the following sp3-bonded semiconductors: C, Si, Ge, Sn, SIC, GaP,
             GaAs, GaSb, InP, InAs, InSb, AIP, AlAs, AISb, ZnSe, and ZnTe. For each of these materials the theory uses only
             thirteen parameters to reproduce the major features of conduction and valence bands. The matrix elements
             exhibit chemical trends: the differences in diagonal matrix elements are proportional to differences in free-atom
             orbital energies and the off-diagonal matrix elements obey the de2 rule of Harrison et al. The lowest energy
             conduction bands are well described as a result of the introduction of an excited s state, s*, on each atom.
             Examination of the chemical trends in this sp’s* model yields a crude but “universal” sp’s* model whose
             parameters do not depend explicitly on band gaps, but rather are functions of atomic energies and bond lengths
             alone. The “universal” model, although cruder than the sp’s* model for any single semiconductor, can be
             employed to study relationships between the band structures of different semiconductors; we use it to predict band
             edge discontinuitiesof heterojunctions.

within the solid, we can compute the corresponding energies of
the tight-binding bandstructures. These cannot be directly com-
pared with experiments such as photoemission, because the
tight-binding bands do not include effects, mainly electron-elec-
tron correlation effects, which in general shift the bands to higher
energy. Other more sophisticated methods, such as the Hartree
Fock method, also produce bands that are too low in energy[35].
Because such energy shifts are nearly constant, as demonstrated
by the Bond Orbital Model[2,3], we can construct an indirect,
internal test of the absolute energies of the tight-binding orbitals
within the solid. The test consists of computing the differences of
two quantities, $ and S,, which are then compared with the
corresponding dtfferences computed from experimental band
structures. From the tight-binding Hamiltonian we obtain
